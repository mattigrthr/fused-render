"""FastAPI app: static shell, filesystem API, HTML rendering, Python execution.

No path restriction anywhere — the whole filesystem is in scope by design
(see DECISIONS.md D2/D3). All `path` query params are absolute filesystem
paths. Endpoints are sync `def` so FastAPI dispatches them to its threadpool,
giving free concurrency for blocking filesystem/subprocess work; /api/run is
async (the fused engine is async; the built-in executor is offloaded).

Execution engine (D69/D70/D204): /api/run follows the persisted preference,
which **defaults to the fused local compute backend** (`engine.py`) whenever the
`fused` package is importable and to the built-in executor otherwise — D204
reversed D70's builtin-by-default. `FUSED_RENDER_ENGINE` still overrides the
whole process: `=builtin` never touches the package even if importable, `=auto`
matches the default's behaviour, `=fused` requires it (fail loudly at startup if
missing).

    Five templates build their daemon's venv with uv and resolve it as
    ``shutil.which("uv")`` — geotiff, zarr_aoi and netcdf's tile servers, plus
    las and pyramid. They have to resolve it that way: a template may ASK a fact
    about its environment but never branch on how the app was installed
    (SPEC §26/MD-11, D166), so "if this is a bundle, look in Contents/Resources"
    cannot live in a template file.

    The macOS bundle ships uv at ``Contents/Resources/bin/uv``, which is neither
    beside the interpreter nor on anyone's PATH — ``envinstall._worker_env()`` was
    the only thing that prepended it, and only for the install worker. So on a DMG
    with no user-installed uv every one of those five silently fell back to
    ``sys.executable``: geotiff lost ``imagecodecs``/``pyproj`` (LZW and JPEG
    tiles stop decoding), zarr_aoi lost ``s3fs``/``gcsfs``/``crc32c`` (every
    remote store fails to open), and las/pyramid raised advice a DMG user cannot
    act on. Before PEP 723 headers were dropped from those templates the script
    venv had incidentally supplied the deps, which is why this only surfaced now
    (D174 accepted a narrower version of it back when the DMG shipped no uv at
    all — it does now, so the premise is gone).

    Fixed here, once, rather than in five templates: the /api/run child and the
    daemon it spawns both inherit this process's environment, so prepending the
    directory makes every existing ``shutil.which("uv")`` start working with no
    template edit. It is also the SAME mechanism the Linux and Windows desktop
    supervisors already use — they prepend their payload's tools dir to the
    server's PATH (``supervisor/paths.py``) — so this closes the platform gap
    instead of adding a second pattern.

    Prepended, so the bundled uv wins over an older system one, matching
    ``_worker_env``. Resolution is ``envinstall.uv_bin()``'s, shared rather than
    restated: it already knows all three packaged layouts, and a second copy would
    drift. No uv anywhere is not an error here — a dev checkout without uv is
    normal, and the templates say so themselves when they need it.
