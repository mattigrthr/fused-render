# fused-render — Implementation Blueprint (M1)

**Status:** Locked for M1 build — 2026-07-04.
Companion docs: `SPEC.md` (requirements, decision markers), `DECISIONS.md` (decision log + project context).
This file is the concrete contract an implementer can build from without further discussion.

Shell = React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (D52/D53; strict tsc gated in the build). Build with `cd frontend && npm run build` — output is NOT committed (D54): dev machines need node, wheels/DMG build it via the hatch hook (scripts/hatch_build.py). Templates, examples and `runtime.js` stay plain ES2020 JS with no build step and no JS dependencies — the rendering primitive is framework-free by design.

---

## 2. CLI (`cli.py`)

```
fused-render [--start-dir DIR] [--port N] [--no-browser]
```

- `--start-dir` default `~` (home). UI starting location only — **whole filesystem is browsable** (no root-scoping concept anywhere).
- `--port` default `1777`.
- Binds `127.0.0.1` only. Prints URL, opens browser after short delay (threading.Timer) unless `--no-browser`.
- `uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=port)`.

---

## 3. HTTP API

All paths in query strings are **absolute filesystem paths**. Server never scopes/rejects by location (v1 has no security layer — deliberate, see SPEC §9). Errors return `{"error": "<message>"}` with 4xx status. Every response carries `Cache-Control: no-cache` (middleware) — app code changes between restarts and user files change on disk; stale cached shell/runtime JS produced half-old UIs during development. The two mutating/executing POSTs (`/api/run`, `/api/fs/write`) require an `X-Fused: 1` header (missing/wrong → 403); it forces a CORS preflight so a foreign page can't fire them blind. Not auth — D3 stands (see DECISIONS.md D36).

### `GET /` and `GET /explorer/view/{path:path}` → shell.html
Same static shell for both; shell JS reads `location.pathname` to route. `/explorer/view/Users/you/data` means fs path `/Users/you/data` (strip `/explorer/view/`, prepend `/`). Legacy `/view/` and `/embed/` URLs are rewritten in place at boot (router.ts).

### `GET /api/fs/stat?path=<abs>`
```json
{
  "path": "/Users/you/data/trips.parquet",
  "name": "trips.parquet",
  "is_dir": false,
  "size": 123456,
  "mtime": 1751600000.0,
  "templates": [
    {"mode": "table", "path": "/…/fused_render/templates/table/template.html", "icon": "/…/fused_render/templates/table/icon.svg"},
    {"mode": "code",  "path": "/…/fused_render/templates/code/template.html",  "icon": null}
  ]
}
```
`templates` is the server-side registry lookup on the basename (SPEC PT-7/PT-8, CT-3): the ordered **mode list**, first entry = default. Each entry carries the template **name** (`mode`), the resolved abs `template.html` path, and the abs path of the `icon.svg` sitting next to the resolved `template.html` (user folder's icon when a user template resolved) or `null` when absent. `templates` is `[]` for unmapped file extensions and `null` registry bindings. A **directory** always matches at least the universal `/` key (`["_listing"]`, SPEC PT-13/D81) and previews like a file — a `.zarr` directory matches `".zarr/"` → `[{"mode": "zarr", …}, {"mode": "_listing", …}]`; it is `[]` only when a `null` binding disables it (the shell then lists anyway). `.html`/`.htm` default to `["_render", "code"]` via the built-in registry (user-rebindable since D73); `_render` is a **sentinel mode** (SPEC PT-12) — `_`-prefixed, no template folder behind it — emitted without touching the filesystem:

```json
"templates": [
  {"mode": "_render", "path": null, "icon": null},
  {"mode": "code", "path": "/…/fused_render/templates/code/template.html", "icon": "/…/fused_render/templates/code/icon.svg"}
]
```

A `_`-prefixed name appearing in a registry list is valid only for the known sentinels (`KNOWN_SENTINELS = {"_render", "_listing"}`, D73/D81); any other is invalid (dropped + `template_error`) — the rest of the sentinel namespace is shell-owned. The user registry (§7, SPEC §16) is consulted first; validation is **per entry** — an entry whose name can't resolve (unsafe name, `template.html` missing in both locations) is dropped from the list and a `"template_error": "<reason>"` field names the first problem (absent otherwise); if the user's value resolves to nothing at all, the built-in list for the extension is used. There is no singular `template` field — removed in M8, no compat alias (shell is same repo).

### `GET /api/fs/list?path=<abs dir>`
```json
{
  "path": "/Users/you/data",
  "entries": [
    {"name": "sub", "is_dir": true,  "size": null,   "mtime": 1751500000.0},
    {"name": "trips.parquet", "is_dir": false, "size": 123456, "mtime": 1751600000.0}
  ]
}
```
Sorted: dirs first, then files, case-insensitive alpha. Includes dotfiles (FS-4 v1). Unreadable entries skipped silently. Non-dir path → 400.

### `GET /api/fs/raw?path=<abs file>`
`FileResponse` — correct MIME via `mimetypes.guess_type`, Range support (free from Starlette). 404 if missing.

### `POST /api/fs/write`  *(requires `X-Fused: 1`)*
Body `{path: <abs>, content: str, expected_mtime?: float}`. Rejects non-absolute paths, directories, and missing parent dirs. Atomic write (temp file in the same dir → fsync → `os.replace`), preserving the target's permission bits on overwrite. Optimistic lock: if `expected_mtime` is given, a changed **or deleted** file → HTTP 409 `{error: "conflict", mtime: <current|null>}`; omitting it writes unconditionally (also how new files are created). Response = the same shape as `/api/fs/stat` (fresh mtime/size) so the editor can re-arm the lock.

### `GET /render?path=<abs .html file>`
Reads file text, injects `<script src="/static/runtime.js"></script>`:
- if `<head>` present (case-insensitive): right after it;
- else: prepended to the document.
Returns `text/html`. Used as iframe src by the shell for both user HTML and templates.

### `POST /api/run`  *(requires `X-Fused: 1`)*
Request:
```json
{"py": "./sine.py", "html": "/Users/you/views/sine.html", "params": {"freq": "2.4"}}
```
- `py` relative → resolved against `dirname(html)`; absolute → used as-is. (`html` may be null only if `py` is absolute.)
- Response is the executor result verbatim (HTTP 200 even for user-code errors — the `ok` field carries success):
```json
{"ok": true,  "result": …, "stdout": "…"}
{"ok": false, "error": {"type": "ZeroDivisionError", "message": "…", "traceback": "…"}, "stdout": "…"}
```
Endpoint is sync `def` → FastAPI runs it in its threadpool → concurrent runPython calls work (RH-4).

### `/api/jobs` — background jobs (SPEC §36, D244)

`GET /api/jobs` → `{jobs, now}` (unguarded read). `POST /api/jobs` upserts one
record from a reporter (X-Fused; applies only the keys present, so a progress
tick cannot blank the title, and answers with the stored record — which is how
the reporter learns `cancel_requested`). `POST /api/jobs/{id}/cancel` flags a
running job; `POST /api/jobs/{id}/dismiss` closes a finished one (409 on a
running one); `POST /api/jobs/clear` closes all finished. State lives in
`fused_render/jobs.py`, in memory. `/api/jobs` is in `calls.SKIP_PREFIXES` — a
tick is bookkeeping about a call, not a call.

### `/api/ai-models` — Hugging Face cache inventory (SPEC §37, D249)

`GET /api/ai-models` → `{cacheDir, hfHome, exists, totalSize, repos}`, one
entry per cached repo (`{id, dir, kind, path, size, files, mtime, lastUsed,
task, taskHelp, taskSource, library, params, paramsEstimated, quantization,
capability, revisions, refs}`), biggest first. `capability` is which local runner
kind could LOAD this — `text-generation`, `text-to-image`, or null for a dataset,
a Space, an embedding model or anything no runner serves (SPEC AI-7a). Answered
here because the task vocabulary and the capability vocabulary both live on this
side; a page deciding for itself would hold a second copy of the mapping.
`exists` is false where the cache directory itself is absent, which is what the
page's empty state distinguishes from a cache that has merely been emptied —
there is no separate `/status` probe, because the sidebar entry it gated is
unconditional (SPEC HF-8, D265). `GET /api/ai-models/revisions?repo=<dir>` → per-revision
`{commit, refs, size, shared, files, mtime}`, where `size` is the revision's
EXCLUSIVE bytes (what deleting it frees) and `shared` what it holds in common
with its siblings; computed on demand because it resolves every snapshot symlink
in the repo. Both are unguarded reads.

`ai_models.py` resolves the cache per request through huggingface_hub's own
precedence (`HF_HUB_CACHE` > `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` > `$HF_HOME/hub` >
`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/huggingface/hub` > `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`) and measures
each repo with `lstat`, skipping the `snapshots/` symlinks (they point back into
the same repo's `blobs/`) and de-duplicating hardlinks by `(st_dev, st_ino)`, so
`size` is bytes on disk and the rows sum to `totalSize`. `lastUsed` is the newest
atime over real files; the ref reads this module makes restore atime afterwards,
so inspecting the cache cannot mark it as used. Sync `def` — the walk is
disk-bound and belongs in the threadpool.

`POST /api/ai-models/delete` (SPEC HF-10..HF-15, D250) takes
`{"targets": [{"dir": "models--org--name", "revision": "<sha>"|null}]}` and
answers with the fresh listing plus `freed` and per-target `failures`. `X-Fused`
guarded (D3). A target names a cache FOLDER — validated as one path segment with
a known kind prefix and joined onto the server's cache dir, never a path from
the body — and a symlinked repo folder is refused rather than followed. A
revision delete removes the snapshot, the blobs no other revision references
(resolved through their links), the refs pointing at that commit, and the whole
repo when it was the last revision.

### `/api/ai-models/hub/*` — Hub search, narrowed and joined (SPEC §39, D255, D313)

`POST /api/ai-models/hub/search {q, task, sort, limit}` (`X-Fused` guarded) ->
`{models, query, endpoint, authenticated}` or, when the far side is unhappy,
`{models: [], error}` with a 200 — the request this server got was fine and the
page has a sentence to show. Each model is `{id, task, taskHelp, pipelineTag,
capability, library, downloads, likes, updated, params, estimatedSize, local,
url}`, where `local` is `{state: "downloaded"|"partial"|"none", size, files,
lastUsed, path, dir}`.

**Every row is one an engine here could LOAD** (D313, narrowed by D316), which
is what `capability` is for — it is never null and it is what the page hands to
`/api/ai/runtime/download`. `_model_row` drops a result whose `pipeline_tag` no
registered runner serves, one with no tag at all, and anything `private`. The
classification is `registry.capability_for_task`, the same function behind the
Local tab's Load button, so a search result and a cached card cannot disagree
about whether a kind of model is runnable. **Gated repos are NOT dropped**
(D316): the row carries `gated` as `"auto"` (accept the licence while signed
in), `"manual"` (the owner grants access by hand) or `null`, and the card turns
that into a pill plus — when the reply's `authenticated` is false — a link to
the repo's Hub page in place of the Download button, so a gate is a step rather
than a missing search result.
`GET /api/ai-models/hub/tasks` -> the offered filters as `{tag, label, help}`,
built by running an editorially-ordered candidate tag list through that same
function (`supported_tags()`): four tags today, twenty-six before. It is an
unguarded read like every other (WF-5): a static glossary that touches nothing.
Search is the asymmetry, and deliberate. It downloads nothing itself, but it is
the one read that LEAVES the machine — an outbound call carrying the user's Hub
token — and D36's protection is the browser refusing to show a foreign page the
*response*, which does nothing about the *request*. Unguarded, a blind
cross-origin GET could spend someone's credential and rate limit while learning
nothing. So the route takes the shape its effect deserves rather than the rule
acquiring a guarded-GET exception. A `task` nothing here runs is a 400, not an
empty grid.

`hub_models.py` is the only outbound request this feature makes. The host is
fixed (`HF_ENDPOINT` honoured but validated as http(s)), the query string is
`urlencode`d, the sort is a fixed map so no raw field reaches the Hub, and the
token is sent and never returned. That token is `huggingface_hub.get_token()`,
reached through `hf_auth.token()` and derived nowhere else in this app (D402):
hf's own resolution — the environment variables first, then its own store —
which is also the resolution a worker gets by calling hf inside its own
interpreter. So this search and the download it leads to cannot disagree about
which credential the machine holds, and no second copy of a precedence rule
exists to drift. Nothing is cached, because hf refreshes an OAuth token in
place as it nears expiry. An unfiltered query **over-fetches 4x (capped at 200)
and truncates after the supported-tag pass**, so `limit` means rows shown rather
than rows requested; a filtered one asks for exactly what it shows, since the Hub
has already constrained it. Answers are memoised for a short TTL — search-as-you-type
would otherwise be one request per keystroke — but **errors are not cached** and
the **local join runs on every request**, outside the cache, so a model deleted a
second ago stops claiming to be downloaded. That join is scoped to the rows
being returned: one `scandir` of the cache root for id->folder, then `_scan_repo`
+ `_revisions` for only the results actually present. It deliberately does NOT
go through `_listing()`, which additionally reads every repo's card, config and
safetensors headers — metadata no Hub row uses. Sizes are recovered from
`safetensors.parameters` (`count * bits / 8`) with the same table `inspect_model`
uses locally; no metadata means no size rather than a guess. Sync `def`: one
bounded outbound call plus a cache walk, so it belongs in the threadpool.

### `/api/ai/runtime`, `/api/ai/catalog` — local inference (SPEC §40, D257)

`GET /api/ai/runtime` → `{runners:[{code,capability,label,available,reason}],
loaded:[{model,capability,runner,state,residentBytes,loadedAt,jobId}],
downloading:[{model,capability,jobId,startedAt}], totalResidentBytes}`.
`downloading` is weights landing on disk — no memory, no eviction, no worker row —
and it is in this reply rather than only in the job list because it is what tells
a page whether to read job rows at all (AI-5a). `GET /api/ai/catalog` → per capability,
the curated suggestions **and the models this disk already holds** (D323), each
entry carrying `source: "curated"|"cached"`, `downloaded` and `loaded` beside
`{id,label,size_gb,note}`. The cached half comes from `ai_models.cached_models()` —
the AI-models listing's own scan, its own capability inference and the FORMAT's own
`loaders` reading, memoised there on directory mtimes, imported here rather than
re-derived. A cached repo joins a row only when that row's resolved runner is among
its `loaders`, so the list stays per-RUNNER (AI-11a) and never offers a repo the
serving engine would refuse. It is APPENDED, so `default`, `catalog.default_for()`
and `catalog.for_capability()` keep resolving over the curated list alone and a bare
`fused.ai.image()` cannot load an arbitrary repo off the disk; consumers read
`default`, never `models[0]`. `POST /api/ai/runtime/load|unload|download` — `X-Fused` guarded, since
they start processes and write gigabytes; `load` and `download` return a `{jobId}`
into the download manager rather than blocking.

`POST /api/ai/cancel` (SPEC AI-1a) → `{cancelled}` — stops a local generation
without unloading the model; false when there was nothing running.

`POST /api/ai` also takes `history`: prior `{role, content}` turns that reach the
worker as messages, ahead of `prompt`. Local models only — the Claude path
refuses it rather than dropping it.

`POST /api/ai/image` (SPEC AI-9) → `{jobId, path, model, prompt, width, height,
steps, guidance, seed}` immediately; the render runs on a thread and reports its
denoising steps to `sys:ai-image:<uid>`. The path and the seed are settled in
that first reply — the server owns both — so there is no second endpoint for the
result and the job record needs no result field. The reply carries the CLAMPED
values (sides 256–2048 snapped to /16, steps ≤100, guidance ≤20), not the
requested ones. The PNG lands in `<home>/ai/images/` and is read back through
`/api/fs/raw`.

`fused_render/ai/` is three modules and a folder of runners. `registry.py` says
what this machine can do (`available()` answers with a REASON, and resolution
skips a runner that cannot run here). `supervisor.py` owns the worker processes:
one resident model per capability, auto-evicting; liveness via `Popen.poll()`
(never `os.kill(pid, 0)` — a zombie answers that yes, and on Windows it
*terminates* the process); stopping via `killpg` on a verified group leader, or
`CTRL_BREAK`/`taskkill /T /F` on Windows. The port-handshake file is named per
BRING-UP (a random per-worker id, never the token), because two workers for one
capability overlap — an eviction's replacement starts while the old one is being
killed — and a shared name let the second one's `unlink` delete the port the first
had just published.

`runners/worker_base.py` is the worker half of that contract, written once: the
four routes, the auth header, the port handshake, the state machine and the
disk-measured download. A runner folder supplies only `download`, `load` and
`generate` and calls `serve()`. Stdlib-only — anything imported there becomes a
dependency of every backend, and it is what makes the contract testable on CI
(`tests/test_ai_worker_base.py` drives the real routes with stub callables;
neither concrete worker can run there). `catalog.py` holds the curated model
lists that used to live inside the sandbox apps.

A runner is a folder with a `pyproject.toml` and a `worker.py`; its venv is built
by `envinstall` (PY-18), not by anything new, and the worker speaks four routes
(`/health`, `/generate`, `/cancel`, `/quit`) on an ephemeral port the child
publishes, authenticated with a per-worker token. Nothing under `fused_render/`
imports mlx or torch — they are named only in a runner's declaration. Those
declarations are **wheels only** (SPEC AI-2a, D266): a source build runs a build
backend in an interpreter uv creates, and `_env_install_worker._uv_env` scrubs
`PYTHON*`/`VIRTUAL_ENV` off every uv call so that interpreter cannot inherit the
macOS bundle's `PYTHONHOME`. A test enforces both halves. **No Hub token is
placed in that environment** (D402): a worker imports `huggingface_hub` and so
finds the machine's token where every other hf caller finds it — hf's own store,
written by the Preferences login button (`server/routers/hf_auth.py`) — while an
`HF_TOKEN` this process inherited is passed through untouched. An earlier version
of that feature kept a pasted token in prefs.json and wrote it in here; letting
hf own the storage deleted the plumbing instead of adding to it.

`POST /api/ai` routes on the model id: one containing a **slash** is a Hub repo id
and goes to the local runner, one without is a Claude alias and goes to the CLI as
before.

### `GET /static/*`
StaticFiles mount for shell + runtime. Templates dir is NOT statically mounted — templates are served through `/render` like any HTML file.

## 4. Executor protocol (`executor.py` + `_child.py`) — ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

- `run_python(path, params, timeout=30.0) -> dict`: routes by target (D72). A `.py` on the **`INPROCESS_HELPERS` allowlist** (the duckdb/structure/xlsx/sqlite readers + api inspector — trusted, fast, never import/exec user code) runs **in-process** via `_run_inprocess`; anything else (user scripts, user template readers, and other shipped `templates/` helpers like the claude agent / geo tile servers) **spawns `[sys.executable, _child.py]`**, writes `{"path", "params"}` JSON to stdin, `subprocess.run(timeout=…)`, parses **last stdout line** as result JSON. Timeout → `TimeoutError` error dict. Garbage/no output → `ExecutorError` with stderr tail.
- `_child.py` (subprocess path): chdir to the .py's dir (relative data paths work), prepend dir to `sys.path`, import via `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`, find callable `main`, bind params (via `_binding.bind_params`) with annotation-based coercion (`"100"`→int, `"2.4"`→float, `"true"/"1"/"yes"/"on"`→bool), missing required arg / non-callable main → structured error. Extra params ignored unless `**kwargs`. Return value must be JSON-native, else clear TypeError suggesting `df.to_dict('records')`. User `print()` captured → returned as `stdout` field. Catches `BaseException` (incl. SystemExit).
- `_run_inprocess` (in-process path): imports the helper, binds params with the same `_binding` coercion, calls `main`, JSON-checks the result, catches `BaseException` → error dict. No chdir (helpers take absolute paths), no stdout capture (helpers don't print; global `sys.stdout` redirect would race the threadpool), no timeout (bounded reads / `ast` parse). Shares the app's macOS TCC grant because it runs in the server (= app) process — that is the point (D72).
- `_binding.py`: `coerce` / `bind_params` / `ParamError`, shared by both paths so param binding is identical.

Fresh process per call = fresh code every call for user code (PY-9); the env is whatever Python launched the server. First-party helpers run in-process (D72).

---

## 5. Injected runtime (`runtime.js`)

Iframe is **same-origin** (src = `/render?path=…` on the same host) → no postMessage protocol; runtime touches an ancestor window directly. The param target is the **topmost same-origin ancestor** (D46): the runtime climbs `window.parent` while the next ancestor is same-origin (probed via a try/catch on `.location.href`) **and not a param boundary** — an ancestor with `_fusedParamBoundary` set stops the climb *below* it (both layout shells set one, D47/D72). In normal view/embed mode the direct parent is already the top, so nothing changes; in a layout mode (panel or tab) the climb stops at each pane's/tab's own embed shell, so params stay pane-local — captured segment-local inside `_layout` by the shell's URL sync. Reads (get/getAll) additionally merge the same-origin ancestor chain *above* the boundary: hand-typed globals on the layout shell URL are visible in every pane (nearer ancestor wins, pane-local wins over all; D72); `set()` only ever writes the target, so a pane setting a globally-present key shadows it locally. Must also work when `/render?path=…` is opened as the top-level page (then `target === window`, also the fallback for a cross-origin ancestor; params live on the /render URL itself alongside `path` — `path` is owned by the server route, treat it as reserved too). Notification is a single channel: `set()` and any ancestor URL write both surface as a `fused:urlchange` event on the target window, and `onChange` fires only when the non-reserved param snapshot actually changed (diff guard — kills loops and the duplicate a self-`set` would otherwise cause). The target URL may carry the parenthesized `_layout` param, which contains literal `&` (D51, §11): the runtime never parses the target search with raw `URLSearchParams` — its `splitSearch` duplicate strips the raw `_layout=(…)` span first and `set()` reinserts it untouched and last.

```js
window.fused = {
  runPython(pyPath, params) -> Promise<result>,
  rawUrl(path) -> string,                         // sync; /api/fs/raw?path=…
  stat(path) -> Promise<statObj>,                 // GET /api/fs/stat
  readFile(path) -> Promise<string>,              // GET raw endpoint as text
  writeFile(path, content, opts?) -> Promise<statObj>,  // POST /api/fs/write
  params: { get(k), getAll(), set(k, v), onChange(cb) -> unsubscribe },
};
```

- **IO helpers:** `stat`/`readFile`/`writeFile` reject with an `Error` carrying the server's message (mirrors runPython's rejection style). `writeFile` opts = `{expectedMtime}` (optimistic lock) and `{create: true}` (create only if absent); an optimistic-lock 409 rejects with an error whose `.type === "conflict"` and `.mtime` = the server's current mtime, so a caller can offer reload/overwrite, while a `create` 409 rejects with `.type === "exists"` — "already there", which is not an overwrite offer. `runPython` and `writeFile` send the `X-Fused: 1` header the server requires on its POSTs (see §3).

Behavior:
- **runPython:** POST `/api/run` with `{py: pyPath, html: <own file path>, params}`. Own file path = `path` query param of the iframe's own URL. Non-ok response → reject with `Error` carrying `.type`, `.traceback`, `.stdout`. If `stdout` non-empty (ok or not), `console.log` it prefixed `[python]`.
- **params.get/getAll:** read `parent.location.search`, excluding reserved keys (`_`-prefixed). `_file` is special: read-only, sourced from the iframe's **own** URL query (the shell puts it on the iframe src), so the shell URL never duplicates the path.
- **params.set(k, v):** throws if `k` starts with `_` or `v` is not a string. Updates parent URL via `parent.history.replaceState` (always replace — PR-3), then fires local onChange listeners. Strings only (PR-5).
- **onChange(cb):** called with `getAll()` result after every applied `set`. (No cross-source change feed in v1 — params only change via the page itself.)
- **Error overlay:** module-level helper — on unhandled promise rejection carrying `.traceback` (i.e. a runPython failure the page didn't catch), render a fixed-position red-bordered overlay with type, message, `<pre>` traceback. Author-handled rejections show nothing.
- **Theme (SPEC §30, D134):** the runtime is also how the appearance reaches a view document, since a React re-render must never touch a live iframe. It runs at the very top of the IIFE — `/render` injects it right after `<head>`, parser-blocking, so it executes before the document's own stylesheet is parsed and there is no flash — and, **only if `<html>` carries `data-fused-theme`**, resolves the theme and writes `data-theme` on that same element. It resolves *itself* (same-origin `localStorage["fused-render:theme"]`, falling back to this document's `matchMedia`) rather than being pushed from the shell, and follows changes via the `storage` event (another window's override) plus its own `matchMedia` change (a System-mode OS flip). Nothing is ever written into a document without the opt-in, so user-authored `.html` views get no theme signal at all. The opt-in must be an `<html>` attribute, not a `<meta>`, precisely because of the injection point.

Top-level `path` handling in shell URL vs iframe URL:
- Shell URL: `/explorer/view/<fs-path>?freq=2.4` — params live here (source of truth, PR-1).
- Iframe URL: `/render?path=<abs html path>` — no user params needed on it; runtime reads/writes **parent's** query string.
- Standalone fallback (`parent === window`): read/write own URL's query, skipping `path`.

## 6. Shell (`frontend/` → `static/shell-dist/`)

SPA, React 18 + Vite (D52/D53; TypeScript, strict). `src/` is layered into aliased areas — the super-app structure: **`@platform`** (shared foundations: `platform/lib/` non-React modules ported ~verbatim from the vanilla shell — router/api/format/bookmarks/layout-codec, same contracts as before — plus `platform/ui/` shared components used by more than one app — `platform/cloud/` (app-cloning's `CloneModal`/`CloneAppHost` and the sibling `Deploy*` components) is gone entirely, SPEC §19/§35), **`@apps/explorer`** (Listing/Preview/Panel/Tabs/Breadcrumb + fs-actions/fs-clipboard), **`@apps/builder`** (Apps hub, NewAppPanel, AppPreviewCard), and **`@shell`** (App, Home, Sidebar, Preferences/Mounts/Templates — the chrome that composes the apps; the sibling `Account` panel that used to live here is removed, SPEC §27). Import direction is enforced by `frontend/scripts/check-boundaries.mjs` (runs first in `npm run build`): platform imports only platform; an app imports only platform and itself — never shell, never another app; shell may import anything. Within that: the router never imports UI (it dispatches a `fused:navigate` event; `platform/lib/hooks.ts` turns it plus `popstate` into a **nav epoch** that keys — i.e. remounts — the active view, the React equivalent of the vanilla per-route DOM rebuild), and the bookmark store never touches the DOM (mutations signal via `notifyBookmarksChanged()`). `Breadcrumb.tsx` may import `Panel.tsx` (`panelUrl`) — both explorer — and shell's `Sidebar.tsx` may import `@apps/explorer/Tabs` (`composeFolderTabsUrl`), since no view imports back — no cycles. The history replaceState/pushState wrapping (→ `fused:urlchange`) lives in `main.tsx` and is load-bearing for the iframe runtimes (D46), not just for the shell's own re-renders; chrome (bookmark buttons, active highlight) re-renders on a **url version** signal that also counts `fused:urlchange`, without remounting views. Layout-mode iframes freeze their `src` at mount — React never rewrites it (a src write reloads an iframe); pane crumb clicks write it imperatively via a ref, and tab frames render as a flat keyed list that only appends/removes (never re-parents/reorders). Routing from `location.pathname`:
- `/` → redirect (replaceState) to `/apps` (the app home; super-app step 2) (start dir from `GET /api/config` → `{"start_dir": "/Users/you", "home": …}` — `source_template` was dropped with the html sentinel modes (D62); the code-view path arrives via `stat.templates` like everything else, and the shell `Config` type dropped it too).
- `/view/<path>` → `stat` it:
  - a target with a non-empty `stat.templates` → preview view — **including a directory** (every directory resolves at least the universal `/` key → `["_listing"]`, SPEC PT-13/D81; the built-in listing is the `_listing` sentinel mode)
  - **dir** with an empty `templates` (a `null` binding disabled it) → listing view — the shell's safety net (a folder must always render something)
  - **file** → preview view (templates or fallback)

**Listing view:** breadcrumb bar (each segment navigates) + rows: icon (dir/file), name, human size, mtime. Columns sortable — sort key/order live in URL params (`?sort=name|size|mtime&order=asc|desc`, replaceState), dirs always group before files, ties fall back to name. Click dir → `pushState` navigate. Click file → `pushState` navigate. `popstate` → re-route.

**Preview view:** breadcrumb + filename header with actions, then dispatch **exactly two-way** (no extension checks left in the shell — `HtmlPreview` is deleted; html arrives through `stat.templates` via the `_render` sentinel, SPEC PT-12):

1. `stat.templates` non-empty → `TemplatePreview`: pick the active entry — `_mode=<name>` on the **shell URL** selects by `mode`, absent or unknown/stale value → `templates[0]` (the default; old `_mode=source` bookmarks land here silently — accepted break, the mode is now named `code`). Ordinary entries: iframe src = `/render?path=<entry.path>&_file=<target file>` with `key={mode}` — a mode switch swaps the src and gets a fresh document. **Sentinel entries** (`_`-prefixed, `path: null`): `mode === "_render"` → iframe src `/render?path=<the file itself>` (no `_file`); `mode === "_listing"` → the shell **mounts its `Listing` component in place of the iframe** (no `_file`, no iframe — SPEC PT-12/D81), so a directory's file listing is a switchable mode; unrecognized sentinels are filtered out defensively. `_file` rides on the iframe's own URL; the shell URL stays clean (its pathname already names the file). The runtime reads `_file` from its own URL first and falls back to the shell URL, so manually opening `/view/<template>.html?_file=<target>` (old bookmarks) also works. Selecting the default mode **deletes** `_mode` (replaceState, clean URLs). Accepted quirk: non-reserved template params (`offset`, …) persist on the shell URL across switches; two modes using one param name differently collide — documented, not prevented.
2. else → fallback: metadata card (name, size, mtime, path) + `Raw / download` link to `/api/fs/raw?path=…`.

**Mode switcher** (in `Preview.tsx`): rendered only when there is more than one entry (`templates.length > 1`); positioned right side of the preview header bar. One **icon-only button** per mode; mode name via native `title` tooltip; active mode tinted accent. Icons load through `GET /api/fs/raw?path=<entry.icon>` (existing endpoint, no new routes) and are **monochrome SVGs** tinted via CSS `mask-image: url(...)` + `background-color: currentColor`, so active/inactive coloring is free. `entry.icon === null` → placeholder: first letter of the mode name in a small rounded box (shell-rendered, no file involved) — except the sentinel modes, which get **shell-baked SVGs** (component-local; sentinels have no folder to ship `icon.svg`): `_render` an eye, `_listing` a list glyph (D81). Clicking a mode writes/deletes `_mode` via `history.replaceState` (D8; same mechanics as the old D40 toggle).

Header actions always include `Raw` (opens raw endpoint in new tab). Iframe fills remaining viewport height, `border: none`.

**Directory views (SPEC PT-13/D65, revised D81):** every directory resolves through the registry like a file — the universal `/` key gives a plain folder `["_listing"]` and `.zarr/` gives `["zarr", "_listing"]`. The built-in listing is the `_listing` sentinel mode, so it rides the ordinary switcher and `_mode` selection: a plain folder shows the listing (single mode, no switcher); a `.zarr` store shows the zarr map with `_listing` a click away (`_mode=_listing`), `TemplatePreview` rendering `<Listing>` in the body for that mode. The old one-way `?listing=1` "Browse contents" button is **removed** (D81) — the switcher's `_listing` icon replaces it. Because embed hides the whole `.preview-header` (and switcher), a `.preview-browse-chip` corner button remains in embed only (`.preview-body` is `position: relative`), toggling the `_listing` mode (writing/deleting `_mode`) so an embedded directory can still reach its members. Annotate is not offered for `_listing` (no iframe).

**Split preview pane (SPEC FS-9..FS-15, D185):** `Listing.tsx` splits into list + preview pane **whenever it is a Listing that has a pane, at every width, and never by a user's say-so** (SPEC FS-9/FS-10): `usePreviewPane(enabled)` takes `enabled=false` for an embedded Listing (the pane's own `_listing` mode), for a frozen-tree snapshot and for a panel pane, which turns the feature off at the source so there is no nesting case — and `pane.on` IS that flag. There is no `?preview` param, no stored on/off state, **and no width GATE**: `useSplitIsWide` and the `shouldShowPane(width)` 700 px threshold it fed were deleted by D282 along with the 30/50/70 width tiers, on the owner's instruction to remove the breakpoint logic. The undragged width is the companion share — 30 %, or **50 % in a container of 1000 px or less** (`companionFrac`, D283, the one step D282 removed and the owner asked back; it is the file sidebar's own function, so the two columns cannot drift). `useSplitWidth` (a `ResizeObserver` in a `useLayoutEffect`, measuring the split CONTAINER and never the viewport) is back for that one boolean and decides the pane's proportion, never its existence. A narrow window gets a narrow listing beside a floored pane, with `_side=off` as the way out. **On top of that flag sits the user's own state, `_side`** (`listing/pane-side.ts`, SPEC FS-10): which of the pane's three modes is showing — `preview` (the row's default view), `claude` (the chat about the row) or `git` (the OPEN folder's working tree, borrowed from `lib/dir-mode` and unchanging with the selection) — or `off`. `Listing` owns it (the pane remounts per selected row, a chosen mode must not), seeds it from the folder URL, writes it through one `setSide` funnel, and renders the pane when `pane.on && sideState.open`; an absent `_side` reads as OPEN at `preview`, since every folder URL predates the param. The pane's header strip is rendered by every one of its states and is the shared `SideChrome`: the close chevron at its left end, the three-mode `ModeMenu` pill at its right — with the reopening half a `SideToggleButton` in the listing's search row, rendered only while `pane.on && !sideState.open`, so exactly one of the two is ever on screen. The pane's file case builds the **same** iframe src as `TemplatePreview` (`/render?path=<default template>&_file=<file>`, SPEC PT-2/PT-8) — one URL construction, so a file previews identically in the pane and full-screen — including PT-9's tail: it picks the first unconditional entry, and for an **all-conditional** list resolves the gates (`resolveConditions`) and shows the first allowed one rather than falling through to the metadata card, matching `Preview.defaultTemplate`'s `templates[0]` fallback; the same PT-12 sentinel filter runs first so a dangling `path: null` entry can never build a `path=null` render URL — and unlike full-screen `Preview`, which mounts `<Listing>` in place of the iframe for the `_listing` sentinel, the pane has no slot for a nested `Listing`, so `_listing` entries are excluded from the pane's candidates entirely (skipped in favor of the file's next template, or the metadata card if `_listing` was the only one). The directory case IS a nested `<Listing embedded>` — the `_listing` mode mounted in the pane, URL-silent, sort pane-local, no keyboard, no pane of its own. *It was a peek: a lone-app embed via the pane-only `_app` sentinel, else a read-only mini child list. `_app` went with the app concept (D264) and the mini list before it; the `.pane-mini-*` rules in `explorer.css` have no renderer left.* **The split is a FRACTION of the container** (SPEC FS-12): pane state is `{ on, frac }`, `frac` is `chosen ?? defaultPaneFrac(width)` — the 30/50/70 step for the measured container unless a drag has chosen one — and `Listing` renders it as `flexBasis: ${frac * 100}%` — so a window resize rescales the pane instead of stranding it at one window's arithmetic, and nothing has to be measured before the first paint (the old measuring `useLayoutEffect` and its `PANE_FALLBACK_W = 420` are gone). The pixel floors live in the drag and in CSS: `dragPaneFrac(containerW, rawPx)` (with `clampPaneWidth`, `shouldShowPane` and `defaultPaneFrac`, all in the router-free `listing/pane-math.ts` so they are testable with no DOM) runs the cursor's distance from the container's right edge through the shared `clampPaneWidth(containerW, width)` (pane ≥ `PANE_MIN_W` 220 px, list ≥ `LIST_MIN_W` 60 px, `PANE_MIN_W` applied last so a container too small for both keeps the pane's floor and scrolls the list) and divides the clamped pixels back out into a fraction, returning `null` for a container too narrow to hold both floors (< 280 px, where the clamp is degenerate and any fraction would describe the container rather than a choice) so that such a drag moves nothing and records nothing; `.listing-pane-slot` and `.listing-main` carry the same two floors as `min-width`, which is what holds them under a *window* resize. The drag commits **only on release** and only when it actually moved (`resized`), so a bare click on the divider — or a drag in a container too narrow to express a split — leaves a still-adaptive pane adaptive. **NOTHING ABOUT THE PANE IS PERSISTED** (SPEC FS-13). Visibility is re-measured, never stored. The dragged fraction lives in `listing/pane-store.ts` as a module-level variable — **one width for the whole document**, get/set, no storage of any kind — so it holds across all client-side navigation (the shell moves by `history.pushState`, `lib/router.ts`, and never reloads) and a **refresh** clears it back to the adaptive default, which is the intended and only reset. `usePreviewPane` seeds `useState` from `getPaneFrac()` on each mount and writes back on pointer-up at three decimals; `sessionStorage` is deliberately not used, since surviving the refresh is exactly what would defeat the reset. *Formerly `panew` in the per-path viewstate store beside the folder's sort, with a `sized` provenance flag, a `savePaneState` that wrote `pane` and `panew` independently, and a `parsePaneFrac` that rejected `>= 1` legacy pixel values on read — all deleted. Per-folder width meant the divider **jumped on ordinary navigation** between a folder that had a saved width and one that did not. `listing/pane.ts` runs a one-time `purgeViewStateParams("panew", "pane")` at module init to clear both keys from every entry; the folder's **sort stays per folder**, which is why the purge names its params. `?preview=true` and its stickiness in `navigate()` are gone too, which retires the D72 ancestor-climb caveat that kept the param off file targets.* Loading states are skeleton shimmer, and the pane is never on the listing's critical path — a stalled pane leaves the list interactive. **Opening a folder SELECTS NOTHING** (SPEC FS-16, D278 superseding D263 and D240): there is no folder auto-select in `Listing.tsx` — no effect, no timing ref, and no decision function to call — so a freshly opened folder has an empty selection and its pane renders the self target's `Select a file to preview.` hint until the user picks a row. *`autoSelectPath`, its `isPageRow` page test and the `selectionClaimed` guard that held the shot back were deleted, not disabled; do not reintroduce them. The rule they implemented — the first `.html`/`.htm` row, else the first row in rendered order, armed per mount and spent at the first settled non-search listing with the pane on — is history, and the reasoning against it is on D278.* Two SEEDINGS remain, and they are the user's own claim rather than a guess: the cross-remount recall store (a row clicked in the pre-stat provisional scaffold rides across the swap), and **`?sel=` on the folder URL**, read once at mount by `pathFromSelParam`. That param is written **debounced** (`SEL_URL_DELAY_MS` = 300 ms in `listing/useListingSelection.ts`, so a held arrow key spends about one `replaceState` a second instead of thirty), is never carried folder-to-folder (`navigate` sets one only when a caller asks), and an embedded listing neither reads nor writes it. **A `?sel=` that names no row selects nothing** (D279): the reconcile's vanished-lead path defers to `selectionAfterVanish(rows, lastSelIndexRef.current)`, which re-anchors to the slot the lead held — the delete/rename case, clamped to the last row when the folder shrank — but returns the empty selection for the `-1` "never seen in these rows" marker, instead of reading it as row zero. The listing's ONE remaining auto-selection is the search top hit (`nextSearchSelection`, SPEC SR-12), which is repeated per re-rank rather than one-shot and yields permanently to a user's own choice. **The row click is ONE model and the pane does not enter into it** (SPEC FS-15): `rowPressAction` (`listing/selection.ts`, pure) answers a press on `pointerdown` — rows are drag sources and WebKit does not reliably deliver the following `click` on a `draggable` element — with `select`/`toggle`/`extend`, or `defer` for a plain press inside a multi-selection (collapsing on the press would make a multi-row drag impossible, so that one waits for a still release); `onRowDoubleClick` navigates **unconditionally**. No click-delay timer either way: the first click of a double-click selects, and the navigation supersedes the pane fetch it started. *There were two models until #430, chosen by `pane.on` — the same click opening a file or not depending on the window's width.* This replaces the deleted `templates/preview/` folder, which was a vanilla-JS fork of this component (D185); `preview` is gone from the built-in `"/"` list, and so is `app` (D264 deleted the app template, the `?_mode=app` view and the pane-only `_app` sentinel with it); the key is now `["_listing", "claude", "git", "graph", "zarr_aoi", "model_card"]` (D193 added `git`, SPEC §33; `history` left with the per-path timeline mode, whose question the `git` view now answers on the folder — D243).

**Param hygiene:** when navigating between files/dirs, drop old view params (fresh query string except `_file` set by dispatch).

**Appearance (SPEC §30, D134):** `lib/theme.ts` owns the one `localStorage` key (`fused-render:theme`) holding System/Light/Dark, resolves it against `prefers-color-scheme`, and writes `data-theme` on `<html>` — one attribute, so a theme change never re-renders (and so can never touch) a live iframe. The FIRST application is an **inline** script in `frontend/index.html`, ahead of every stylesheet, because the resolved theme must be on the document before first paint; `App` then mounts `useThemeSync()` for later changes (another window via `storage`, a System-mode OS flip via `matchMedia`). `shell.css` is fully tokenized — no colour literal survives outside its two `:root` palette blocks — with translucent washes riding an `rgba(var(--tint), a)` triple that flips white→black. The switch itself is the **Appearance** section of `views/Preferences.tsx` — a three-way radio group in the ordinary `prefs-section` shape, and the only section on that page that writes `localStorage` instead of `/api/prefs`. `useThemeSync()` stays mounted in `App` regardless: it is what handles OS flips and cross-window convergence in `/embed` pane shells, where no picker is ever mounted. View documents are reached by the injected runtime, not from here (§5).

### 6.5 Sidebar & bookmarks (M2)

Layout: `#app` becomes two-column flex — fixed sidebar (~220px, `--bg-alt`, right border) + existing content column (breadcrumb + content).

- **Home entry:** icon + "Home"; click → `navigate(config.home)`. `/api/config` response gains `"home": os.path.expanduser("~")`.
- **Bookmark capture:** "+ Bookmark" button right-aligned in the breadcrumb bar (present on every view); shows accent "starred" state when the current URL is already bookmarked. On click: `{id: crypto.randomUUID(), name: renderedTitle || basename(currentFsPath), url: location.pathname + location.search, created_at: Date.now()}` appended to store; sidebar re-renders. `renderedTitle` is the previewed page's own `<title>` when known (StatView, threaded through `Breadcrumb`) — preferred over the file's basename so a page's authored title wins.
- **Store (D75):** server-side `~/.fused-render/bookmarks.json`, JSON array (tree). Backend in `fused_render/shell/` — `storage.py` (home dir via `home_dir()`/`FUSED_RENDER_HOME`, atomic `read_json`/`write_json`) + `bookmarks.py` (`APIRouter`: `GET /api/bookmarks` → `{exists, bookmarks, missing}`; `PUT` whole-tree, atomic, last-write-wins, `X-Fused` guard). Frontend `bookmarks.ts` keeps an in-memory cache (`loadBookmarks()`/`allBookmarks()` sync off it), hydrated once at boot by `hydrateBookmarks()`; each mutation clones → `await`s the PUT → advances the cache (no optimism/rollback — cache never holds unpersisted state). The one-time legacy `localStorage["fused.bookmarks"]` import (D75) has been removed (D104) — every pre-D75 install has long since migrated. A 30 s `setInterval` in `main.tsx` calls `refreshBookmarks()` (a `GET` through the same serial queue, re-rendering only on a real diff) so another tab's/window's edits converge (D77 — eventual ≤30 s, last-write-wins on simultaneous writes). Hydration, every mutation, and the poll all run through one `enqueue` chain, so no read/write ever interleaves (closes the hydration/mutation race Bugbot flagged). `shell/` is the seam for future shell-state backends, kept out of `server.py`'s fs/render internals (and acyclic — it never imports `server`).
- **Missing-file flag (D127):** `GET /api/bookmarks`'s `missing` field is bookmark ids whose target is confirmed gone from disk — a display-only side-channel, recomputed fresh on every GET and never written into `bookmarks.json` or round-tripped through `PUT`. `bookmarks.py` flattens the tree (`_flatten_bookmarks`, arbitrary folder depth) and fans the existence checks out concurrently on a dedicated `ThreadPoolExecutor` under one wall-clock budget (`_MISSING_CHECK_BUDGET_S`), mirroring `recents.py`'s `CHECK_BUDGET_S`/`_CHECK_POOL` — a check that outlives the budget is NOT flagged (fail open). Existence is checked via `pathops.exists` (new alongside the existing `is_file` trio), mount-safe (routes a mount-backed path through `mounts.rc_stat_for`, never a kernel stat) and, unlike Recents' files-only contract, also accepts a directory (a bookmark may target a listing). Frontend `bookmarks.ts` tracks the ids in a separate `missingIds` set (never merged into the persisted tree), exposed via `isBookmarkMissing(id)`; `Sidebar.tsx` adds a warning glyph (own stacking context so the row's stretched-link overlay doesn't swallow its hover/title) and a hover-card note — the row's name keeps its normal color, on owner request. `main.tsx` also refreshes `missingIds` immediately on window `focus` (in-flight guarded, mirroring `ServerStatusBanner`'s probe, D126), in addition to the existing 30s poll. Recents (§29, D115) is unchanged — it stays hidden-when-missing by deliberate owner choice, so this flag is Bookmarks-only.
- **Bookmark row:** name ellipsized, rendered as a real `<a href="<url>">` (verbatim URL per D20; href kept for middle-click/copy-link). Plain click is intercepted: it **arms** the bookmark for update tracking and routes in-shell via `navigateUrl(url)` (pushState that preserves the query string, unlike `navigate()`). Hover shows a floating card beside the sidebar: decoded target path + saved params as a key/value grid ("no params" when none); card hides during rename/delete. Hover also reveals ✎ rename (inline `<input>`, Enter/blur commits, Escape cancels) and ✕ delete (no confirm). Active bookmark (url == current URL) is highlighted.
- Order: creation time. Duplicates allowed.
- **Bookmark updating (D38):** the armed bookmark `{id, url}` lives in sessionStorage `fused.armedBookmark` (survives refresh, not new tabs). `breadcrumb.js` renders a hidden "Update bookmark" button left of "+ Bookmark"; `syncUpdateButton()` shows it iff armed, same pathname, and `location.search` differs from the armed url's search. Clicking it overwrites the bookmark's url with the current one and re-arms against it. A pathname change disarms permanently; deleting the armed bookmark disarms. Param changes are observed by `main.js` wrapping `history.replaceState` (the iframe runtime writes params through the parent's replaceState, which fires no native event) to dispatch a `fused:urlchange` window event; sidebar delete also dispatches it instead of importing breadcrumb (one-way deps, D28).

### 6.6 Recents (D115, SPEC §29)

Sidebar section listing the last 3 files opened, each with the params they last
had. Backend `shell/recents.py` (beside bookmarks/prefs): `~/.fused-render/recents.json`
holds `{collapsed, entries: [{url, openedAt, title?}]}` — urls verbatim incl. query
(D20 posture), newest first, deduped by target fs path, capped at 20; `GET
/api/recents` filters entries whose file no longer exists (without deleting
them), `POST /api/recents/open {url, title?}` records (file-view `/view/` urls only —
directories and `_`-sentinels no-op), `PUT /api/recents/collapsed` persists the
fold with the data (D44 posture). Frontend `lib/recents.ts` mirrors
`bookmarks.ts` (sync cache, serial queue, `notifyRecentsChanged` signal); its
`useRecentsTracking(fsPath, isDir, title)` is mounted in `App.tsx`'s StatView
(the seam it used to share with the per-file session hooks, removed in D329) —
records the open once the stat confirms a file,
then re-records the current url (and the page's own `<title>`, once known)
on every `fused:urlchange`/`popstate` (500 ms debounce) or title change, so
the entry tracks live param and title changes. Display order is
**stable-slot**, not raw MRU (RC-11): `displayRecents()` keeps session-scoped
slots — a displayed file's row updates in place (rows keyed by fs path; the
store notifies on visible changes only, urls included so hrefs stay fresh,
and param churn moves nothing); only a not-displayed file entering at
the top shifts rows, and a vanished file's slot fills from the bottom.
Sidebar rows prefer the recorded
`title` (the page's own `<title>`) and fall back to the basename otherwise
(D22, extended); click = `navigateUrl` (query-preserving), arms nothing; the
heading toggles the fold (count pill as the collapsed signal, no chevron — D44
visual language); the section is hidden while empty.

## 7. Template contract

- Built-in bindings ship as data — **`fused_render/templates/registry.json`** (D73), exactly the user-registry format: **suffix-pattern key → ordered list of template names, first = default** (M8). A name is a folder name, never a filename:
```json
{
  ".parquet": ["table"],
  ".csv": ["duckdb", "code"], ".tsv": ["duckdb", "code"],
  ".json": ["tree", "code"],
  ".py": ["code", "api"],
  ".html": ["_render", "code"], ".htm": ["_render", "code"],
  ".zarr/": ["zarr", "_listing"], "/": ["_listing"],
  "…": ["etc"]
}
```
(Full mapping + per-row rationale: SPEC PT-7 table.) `_templates_for(path, is_dir)` matches `os.path.basename(os.path.normpath(path))` against both registries with **one matcher** (`_match_registry`, SPEC CT-3): keys are dot-anchored suffix patterns — compound (`.tar.gz`), `*` wildcard = exactly one whole non-empty segment, trailing `/` = **directory key** (a `.zarr` store matches `".zarr/"`; dir keys match only directories, file keys only files). Specificity: more segments > fewer, ties broken rightmost-first with literal > `*`; a match needs a non-empty stem. Both registries are read per resolution by one loader (`_load_registry`); a built-in parse failure surfaces as `template_error`, and a test pins the shipped file (parses, every name resolves).
- **Name resolution — one rule everywhere (SPEC PT-6):** `<name>` → `~/.fused-render/templates/<name>/template.html` if it exists, else `fused_render/templates/<name>/template.html`, else unresolvable. Applies identically to built-in and user registry entries; a user folder shadows a built-in of the same name. **Sentinel special case (SPEC PT-12):** a name in `KNOWN_SENTINELS` (`{"_render", "_listing"}`, D81) never resolves through the filesystem — the resolver emits `{"mode": "_<name>", "path": null, "icon": null}` directly, and it is referenceable from either registry's lists (D73); any other `_`-prefixed name is invalid (dropped + `template_error` — the rest of the sentinel namespace is shell-owned). `_listing` (the built-in directory listing) is the default of the universal `/` directory key; the shell renders its own `Listing` component for it rather than an iframe (D81). `icon` = the `icon.svg` beside the resolved `template.html`, or `null`. `templates/vendor/` has no `template.html` so it can never resolve; the `/template-assets` mount is unchanged.
- **User overrides (M7 + M8, SPEC §16):** the resolver consults `~/.fused-render/templates/registry.json`, and any user match beats the built-in registry — including for `.html`/`.htm` (the old CT-4 exemption is dropped, D73) and for directory keys (D65's package-only restriction is dropped, D73). Keys follow the same CT-3 grammar above; values are `list | string | null`: a **list** is the full ordered mode list (replace semantics; the `"..."` entry splices the built-in list in place — dedup against explicit names, more than one `"..."` invalidates the entry, splice with no built-ins expands to nothing); a **string** is a single-mode list of that name (unchanged D50 meaning); **`null`** = no template at all, shell fallback (plain listing for a directory key). Names must be a single safe path segment (no `/`, `\`, `.`, `..`) since they're joined into a path — correctness guard, not auth (D3). Validation is per entry: an unresolvable entry is dropped and `template_error` on the stat payload names the first problem; a user value resolving to nothing falls back to the built-in list. Registries are read on every resolution (no restart, no cache); missing dir/registry is a clean no-op. Constants `BUILTIN_REGISTRY`/`USER_TEMPLATES_DIR`/`USER_REGISTRY` in `server/templates.py`; runtime untouched — the shell obeys `templates` (§3, §6), and M4 auto-reload already live-reloads previews when the user edits their template or readers (registry edits apply on next stat, open previews don't watch it).
- **Theming a built-in template (SPEC §30/AP-8, D134):** a template that wants to follow the app's appearance sets `data-fused-theme="shell"` on its `<html>` and declares two palette blocks — `:root { color-scheme: dark; --token: …; }` plus a `:root[data-theme="light"]` twin defining the same token set — with **every** colour in its stylesheet coming from a token (a hardcoded colour is one light mode can't repaint; `tests/test_theme.py` enforces this for the tier-1 set). The injected runtime writes `data-theme` for opted-in documents only (§5), so omitting the attribute is how a template stays exactly as it is — which is what the light-by-design (AP-10), self-toggling (AP-11) and deferred (AP-12) templates do. Colours a template hands to a *JS* library (maplibre paint expressions, chart ramps) can't use `var()` and are out of scope; colours it writes through an inline `style="…"` attribute can.
- Template receives target file as read-only param `_file`. Templates are ordinary renderable HTML: same runtime, same powers. Templates reach the filesystem through the runtime IO helpers (`fused.rawUrl`/`stat`/`readFile`/`writeFile`), never by fetching `/api/fs/*` URLs directly — one code path, and the write guard/lock come for free. Helper files sit inside the folder as `reader.py` etc.; relative `runPython('./reader.py', …)` just works because the `html` path sent to `/api/run` is the template's real path. Each built-in folder also ships a **monochrome `icon.svg`** (single fill — `currentColor` or plain black, only alpha matters since the shell masks it; square viewBox, 24×24 suggested, legible at 16px).
- Vendored JS libraries (marked, CodeMirror; and the sci decoders `geotiff.bundle.mjs`, `netcdfjs.bundle.mjs`, `zarrita.bundle.mjs`) live in `fused_render/templates/vendor/` and are served from a dedicated absolute mount `GET /template-assets/*` (a relative `<script src>`/`import` in a template would resolve against `/render`, not the templates dir). All committed local files — no CDN/network at runtime (D3). Regenerate the CodeMirror bundle via `scripts/vendor-codemirror/build.sh`, and the sci bundles via `scripts/vendor-sci/build.sh` (both Node 22; each emits a single self-contained ESM module).
- The sciViz core shared by the `geotiff/`, `netcdf/`, and `zarr/` templates (colormap LUTs, stretch/stats/histogram, canvas draw, and the plain-DOM UI kit) is first-party, not vendored — it lives in `fused_render/templates/shared/sciviz.mjs` and is served from its own absolute mount `GET /template-shared/*` (kept separate from `/template-assets` so `vendor/` stays third-party-only; like `vendor/`, `shared/` has no `template.html` so it can never resolve as a template name).
- `geotiff/`, `netcdf/`, `map/`, and `zarr_aoi/` each spin up a persistent localhost tile daemon (`tile_server.py` / `grid_tile_server.py` / `vector_tile_server.py`, bound to `127.0.0.1` on a random port) so MapLibre pan/zoom isn't capped by `runPython`'s ~700ms per-call subprocess cost; the daemon serves tiles/metadata straight to the template's iframe instead of through `/api/run`. Endpoints are read-only GETs (plus `map/`'s async `/open`) and answer `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — the opposite CORS posture from the main server's D36 guard, and deliberately so (D122): the daemon's only client is a cross-port iframe that needs to read the response, unlike `/api/run`'s same-origin caller. Access is gated by a **per-daemon token** (not CORS, and not the loopback bind — a same-browser page can fetch loopback cross-origin): each daemon mints `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` at startup, stores it in its state file, and returns it from `main("ensure")`; every endpoint except `/ping` requires `?t=<token>` (403 otherwise), and the templates thread it into their daemon URLs (the sci-viz `dURL()` chokepoint, `pyramid/`'s `/ltile` URL, and `map_render.py`'s tile/status/meta URLs).

**M1 templates** (folder names per M8 renames — `table/`, `image/`, `text/`):

- `table/` (`template.html` + `reader.py`):
  - reader `main(file: str, offset: int = 0, limit: int = 100)` → `{"columns": [...], "rows": [...], "total_rows": N}` via pyarrow (`pq.read_table(file).slice(offset, limit).to_pylist()`); cell values must be JSON-safe — stringify non-JSON scalars (timestamps, bytes, decimals) in the reader.
  - UI: table, row-count line ("rows 0–99 of 12,345"), Prev/Next buttons paging via `offset` param → `fused.params.set('offset', …)` → onChange → refetch; the call site passes `offset`/`limit` as **numbers** (params are URL strings — `Number()` where read). Loading + error states.
- `image/`: `<img src="/api/fs/raw?path=" + encodeURIComponent(fused.params.get('_file'))>`, centered, `max-width/height: 100%`, filename caption. No runPython needed.
- `text/`: `fetch('/api/fs/raw?path=…')` → text → `<pre>`. Guard: file > 2 MB → show "too large" note with raw link instead. Monospace, preserved whitespace.

**M2 templates** (added alongside M1; same runtime, same `_file` contract, same dark palette):

- `markdown/`: `fetch` raw → render with vendored `marked` (`/template-assets/marked.min.js`). GitHub-ish readable column (~46rem, centered). No sanitizer by design — local trust model (D3). Guard: file > 2 MB → "too large" note + raw link.
- `csv/` (`template.html` + `reader.py`): same UX as table (table, "rows X–Y of N", Prev/Next via `offset` param, typed call-site params). Reader `main(file, offset=0, limit=100)` via pandas; `.tsv` → tab sep, else comma. Reads the full file once for an honest `total_rows`, returns only the page. Same JSON-safe cell stringifying as `table/reader.py` (NaN → null, timestamps/bytes/decimals coerced).
- `tree/`: `fetch` raw → `JSON.parse` → collapsible tree in pure JS (no library). Objects/arrays fold (▾/▸), keys/primitives type-colored, arrays/objects show count, nodes deeper than depth 2 start collapsed. Parse failure → error + first 2 KB raw. Guard: file > 5 MB → "too large" note + raw link. Also serves `.geojson`.
- `xlsx/` (`template.html` + `reader.py`): openpyxl `read_only=True`, first row is header. Reader `main(file, sheet="", offset=0, limit=100)` → `{sheets, sheet, columns, rows, total_rows}`. Template adds a sheet `<select>` (shown when >1 sheet) wired to a `sheet` param (resets `offset` on change); paging like csv, typed call-site params (`sheet` stays a string). JSON-safe cells (datetimes → isoformat, None → null).
- `pdf/`: thin filename header + full-height `<embed type="application/pdf">` of the raw endpoint.
- `media/`: branches on extension — `<video>` for mp4/mov/m4v/webm, `<audio>` for mp3/wav/m4a/ogg/flac. `controls`, centered, filename caption, video constrained to viewport.
- `code/`: **editable** CodeMirror 6 (vendored `/template-assets/codemirror.bundle.js`, global `CM`), `CM.oneDark` theme to match the shell. `basicSetup` line numbers; language chosen by extension (py/js/ts/json/yaml/html/css + StreamLanguage shell/toml; unknown → plain). Guard: file > 2 MB → "too large" note + raw link (no editor). Top bar (matches other templates' `#bar`): filename + Saved/Modified status + Save button (disabled when clean). Save flow: `fused.stat` arms the mtime on load → `fused.writeFile(file, doc, {expectedMtime})` on save; Cmd/Ctrl+S bound at the window (CM's `keymap` isn't in the bundle); dirty tracked via `EditorView.updateListener` (docChanged); `beforeunload` warns when dirty. On a 409 conflict a bar banner offers **Reload** (refetch + re-arm, discard local) or **Overwrite** (write with no lock, re-arm).

## 9. Verification checklist (M1 done =)

Automatable (curl / CLI):
1. `python -c "import fused_render.server"` etc. — all modules import.
2. Start `fused-render --no-browser --port <test>`; then:
   - `/api/config` → start_dir
   - `/api/fs/list?path=/tmp`-equivalent → entries
   - `/api/fs/stat` on a `.parquet` → `templates[0]` is `{"mode": "table", …}` pointing at templates/table/template.html
   - `/api/fs/raw` on a text file → bytes + MIME
   - `/render?path=<any .html view>` → contains `runtime.js` script tag
   - `POST /api/run` `{py: <abs path to a .py with main()>, params: {...}}` → `ok: true`, payload
   - `POST /api/run` with missing main / raising main / non-JSON return → `ok: false`, structured error
   - executor timeout: `main` sleeping past a short timeout → TimeoutError dict
3. Parquet reader: generate small parquet via pyarrow in a temp dir, `POST /api/run` the reader with offset/limit → correct slice + total.

Manual (browser, after build): browse dirs, click parquet → paged table, click png → image, click sine.html → slider updates URL live, refresh restores, back/forward navigates dirs.

## 10. Style constraints

- Python: stdlib + fastapi + uvicorn + pyarrow only. Type hints on public functions. No classes where a function does.
- Shell: React 18 + Vite + strict TypeScript (D52/D53), function components + hooks only; no state library, no router library (the URL model is bespoke — `_layout` cannot ride a stock router). Small files > clever files.
- Template/runtime JS: no dependencies, no build. `const`/`let`, template literals, async/await.
- Shell CSS: system font stack, no framework. Dark theme is the product look — single palette in shell.css `:root` vars (bg #131417, panel #1b1d21, border #2a2d33, text #e8eaed, accent #5b9dff), `color-scheme: dark`; templates and examples match it.
- Error messages: always actionable — say what was wrong AND what shape was expected.

## 11. Panel mode (M5) — contracts

Split-pane grid of `/embed` iframes; the whole arrangement + per-pane locations + all params live in one bookmarkable URL. Full requirements in SPEC §14 (LM-1..LM-12), decisions D45/D46.

**Route sentinel.** `/explorer/view/_panel` (and `/explorer/embed/_panel`) is a sentinel pathname, not a file. `shell/App.tsx`'s route dispatch intercepts it under both prefixes **before** the `statPath` call, rendering `Panel.tsx` + the layout-mode breadcrumb (sidebar only outside embed). The pane tree lives in the reserved `_layout` query param. Zero server changes — the server already serves the shell for any view/embed path. *Pre-rename `/view/_panel` URLs (bookmarks, `.bookmark` files, external links) are rewritten once at `router.ts` module init, so they still land here.*

**`_layout` codec** (`platform/lib/layout-codec.ts`, shared with tab mode §12). The pane tree lives in the reserved query param `_layout` (`_` prefix → invisible to `fused.params`, PR-6). `,` = row (side by side), `;` = column (stacked), `(…)` groups for nesting; a leaf = the pane's fs path + optional pane-local query. Within a segment the structural chars `, ; ( ) %` (and `?` inside the path, so the first `?` always separates path from query) are percent-encoded (`%25 %2C %3B %28 %29 %3F`) so the delimiters stay unambiguous; one left-to-right decode pass reverses it (`%25` → `%` and scanning continues, so literal escaped chars survive). URL grammar (D51): the whole value is **parenthesized and emitted last** — `?global=1&_layout=(…)` — and `&` is **literal inside the parens**, so the codec string keeps `, ; ( ) / ? & =` literal for a readable address bar; only `% #`/space are escaped when placing it inside the parens (one `decodeURIComponent` pass reverses that). Because `&` is literal, plain `URLSearchParams` cannot parse a layout URL: every shell-query read goes through the codec's `splitShellSearch` (balanced-paren scan — safe because literal parens inside segments are codec-escaped, so the only literal parens in the span are structural and balanced; returns the decoded codec string + the remaining params, excluding the span even when it is broken). Strict read: an unwrapped `_layout` value is not this grammar and reads as absent; an unbalanced span (paste-truncated trailing `)`, accepted breakage) is invalid → the mode's missing-layout fallback. The runtime (injected standalone, imports nothing) duplicates the scan as `splitSearch`: `fused.params` get/getAll parse only the non-layout remainder, and `set()` rebuilds the query with the raw `_layout=(…)` span untouched and last — layout URLs stay readable across param writes.

**Pane-local params (D72).** The panel shell sets `window._fusedParamBoundary = true` (set at render, cleared on unmount — the shell window survives SPA navigation, a stale flag would corrupt the next view), so every pane's pages read/write their **own pane's `/embed` URL**; the ordinary URL-sync captures the full pane query — user params included — segment-local inside `_layout`. The layout URL's top-level query carries only hand-typed globals (never promoted by the shell; readable from every pane via the runtime's ancestor-read fallback, §5, and passed through untouched by the sync). The Split entry (`Breadcrumb.tsx`) puts the current view's **whole** query into each pane segment — no partitioning.

**Panes.** Each pane is an `/embed/<path>` iframe (D39) with a bar: clickable path crumbs (click navigates that pane's iframe), split-right, split-down (new pane duplicates the pane's live location), maximize (transient — a `.maximized` class, `position:absolute inset:6px` inside the `position:relative` `.layout-root`, never encoded in the URL), close. Closing collapses single-child splits; closing the last pane exits to `/explorer/view/<that pane's path><query>`. *Entry into panel mode is no longer a pair of buttons in the breadcrumb's own layout zone (that zone is deleted): split-right/split-down are items in the path `⋮` menu, on a file preview only — SPEC LM-10. The PANE bar's split buttons are unaffected.*

**URL sync up.** The panel view observes each pane's live location on the iframe `load` event **and** the pane window's `fused:urlchange` event (attached via the codec's shared `attachEmbedUrlChange` — a window-expando marker `_fusedUrlHooked` re-attached after each load, since the embed shell dispatches the event on client-side SPA navigation that fires no `load`). On either, it reads the pane's same-origin `contentWindow.location` (pathname under `/embed/`), updates that leaf, and re-encodes `_layout` via `history.replaceState` — guarded to only write when the encoded value changed. That replaceState fires the shell's own `fused:urlchange` (the shell wraps both `replaceState` and `pushState`), so the update-bookmark button reacts (D38). Each pane's effect **detaches its own hook on unmount** (`detachEmbedUrlChange`), so navigating away or closing a pane leaves nothing firing. *The vanilla shell did this with a `stopPanel()` called at the top of `route()`, parallel to `stopListingWatch()`; React's unmount cleanup is what replaced it.*

## 12. Tab mode (M6) — contracts

Tabbed set of `/embed` iframes, one visible at a time; same URL-is-state model as §11. Full requirements SPEC §15 (TM-1..TM-10), decisions D47/D48.

**Route sentinel.** `/explorer/view/_tab` and `/explorer/embed/_tab`, intercepted in the same route dispatch exactly like `_panel` (and reached from the pre-rename shapes by the same legacy rewrite). The tab list is a **flat top-level `,` row** of the shared `_layout` codec (§11); nested `;`/`()` structure is defensively flattened to leaves on parse. Missing/unparseable `_layout` → single tab of the start dir.

**Param independence.** Same contract as panel mode (§11, D72): the tab shell sets `window._fusedParamBoundary = true` (cleared on teardown — the shell window survives SPA navigation, a stale flag would corrupt the next view), and the runtime's ancestor climb stops below it (§5). Each tab's pages therefore read/write their **own pane's `/embed` URL**; the ordinary URL-sync captures the full pane query — user params included — **segment-local** inside `_layout`. The tab URL's top-level query carries only hand-typed globals. A nested `_panel` inside a tab stays pane-local among its own panes (its own boundary) and isolated from other tabs.

**Tabs** (`apps/explorer/Tabs.tsx`). Iframes are **lazy-mounted on first activation and kept alive** (`display:none` when inactive) — state survives switching; iframes are never re-parented (that would reload them), only the bar is rebuilt. Tab label = basename of the tab's live path (sentinels label as `Panel`/`Tabs`); per-tab close `×`; trailing `+` opens a new tab at the start dir. The **active tab is not encoded in the URL** (refresh/bookmark restores the first tab — deliberate, avoids update-bookmark churn). Closing the last tab exits to a plain view of its live location in the active prefix. URL sync + `fused:urlchange` attachment (the codec's shared `attachEmbedUrlChange`/`detachEmbedUrlChange`, expando `_fusedUrlHooked`) and per-tab unmount teardown mirror §11.

**Folder entry** (`sidebar/BookmarksSection.tsx` → `Tabs.tsx`'s `composeFolderTabsUrl`, the documented acyclic import). Clicking a folder's name/row expands the folder (if collapsed) and opens `/explorer/view/_tab?_layout=(<children>)` — each child bookmark's pathname becomes the segment path and its **entire saved query stays segment-local** (no hoisting, no collisions; a `_panel`/`_tab` child just works since a segment path may be a sentinel). Only the folder glyph toggles collapse without opening. Folder click arms nothing; ★ Bookmark on the tab view saves the composed URL as a normal bookmark with the full D38 update flow.
