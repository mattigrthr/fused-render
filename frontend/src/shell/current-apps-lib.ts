// The rules live server-side and are worth restating here because this file
// used to hold the old ones: a NEW task adds its app to the table; nothing
// removes one automatically (archive every task and the row stays); the row's
// cross removes the app AND archives every task under it. Every kind of app
// counts — any workspace folder with a declared page (`~/Fused/local`,
// `~/Fused/showcase`, …) and linked apps anywhere on disk (the registered-apps
// registry). What this file keeps is the CLIENT half: the row shape, the
// containment test the app page's Tasks tab applies, the page's URL codec, and
// the drag-ordered sequence layer.
//
// EVERY app is rendered — the list is not capped (owner, 2026-08-26).

// ---- the displayed order: a sequence per app --------------------------------
//
// Rows render by DESCENDING sequence number, and a sequence changes for exactly
// two reasons: an app that is not in the list gets one, and the user drags a
// row. The store's added order seeds the sequences and then stops mattering —
// this list is something the user reads and points at, and a list that
// reshuffles itself under the cursor cannot be pointed at.
//
// The store is a plain Map held at MODULE level by the section, hydrated from
// and written back to localStorage (`ORDER_KEY` there) — so the order the user
// dragged survives a reload and the next launch, per machine. The owner picked
// localStorage over a server-side pref: a synchronous read means no load race
// against the list fetch, and there is no endpoint, no file format and no
// multi-window write conflict to arbitrate. The cost is that it is per browser
// profile and does not follow the user to another machine.
//
// An app that LEAVES the list (removed by its cross) is FORGOTTEN — sequence and
// all — so if it comes back it comes back as new, at the top. Nothing removed is
// remembered; that is the owner's rule. It also bounds the store by
// construction: what is held, and what is saved, is the apps on the desk and
// nothing else.
//
// The prune is guarded on a non-empty input so a list that has not loaded yet
// cannot wipe the order.
//
// Pruning makes assignment NON-MONOTONE, which is dangerous for state two tabs
// share — pruning per-tab against a per-tab live set is a write loop waiting to
// happen (Bugbot, 2026-08-26, on exactly that). What makes it safe here is that
// the tabs do not race to describe the world: only a DRAG writes to the store
// (see CurrentAppsSection), and a drag is one user gesture, not a poll. A fetch
// changes the order on screen and saves nothing, so there is no second writer to
// disagree with.
