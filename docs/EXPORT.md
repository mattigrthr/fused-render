# Exporting a page for hosted serving

fused-render is local-only: the server binds `127.0.0.1` and hosts nothing (SPEC
§1). Exporting does not change that. It is a **local `POST /api/export` call on
the already-running server** that packs a renderable page and its dependencies
into a portable *bundle* directory. A separate hosting layer — the `fused`
wheel's `build_html_artifact` — turns that bundle into a served app. Export
touches no network — it only writes files to a local directory.

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:1777/api/export \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Fused: 1' \
  -d '{"page": "/abs/path/to/page.html", "out": "/abs/path/to/bundle"}'
```

To actually publish a page to a hosted URL, hand the exported bundle to the
`fused` CLI directly (`fused share create --public`), which mints the URL on a
hosted environment.

Or use **Publish** (SPEC §48, `docs/PUBLISH.md`), which takes the same bundle
the other way: it builds a self-contained static site around it — one that
carries its own Python interpreter, so a `runPython` page needs no server at
all — and hands that to a provider the author is already signed into. Publish
is the consumer of the blocking errors below: what makes a page un-exportable
(EX-3, EX-4) is exactly what makes an app un-publishable, reported once.

`page` and `out` must both be absolute filesystem paths (same convention as
every other endpoint). Export is **non-destructive** — it never deletes an existing
file — so `out` must be **empty** (or not yet exist); a non-empty `out` is rejected.
Re-export to a fresh directory. Three
optional fields tune the bundle: `include` (extra page-relative files to bundle as
assets) and `exclude` (files to drop from the bundle) — see "Choosing which files
are bundled" below, both arrays of relative paths defaulting to empty — and
`cache_max_age` (a string, default `"0s"`; see "Caching" below). On success the
response is
`{"out", "entrypoints": [...], "assets": [...], "warnings": [...]}` — the same
shape written into `manifest.json` below, plus the resolved `out` directory and
any advisory warnings. On a blocking export problem (see "Rules the exporter
enforces" below) the response is a `400` `{"error": "..."}`; the `X-Fused` header
is required on every call, like any other mutating endpoint (a missing/invalid
header is a `403`).

## What a bundle contains

A bundle (format **v2**) is `manifest.json` plus a single `files/` payload dir mirroring
the page's folder — every bundled file at its real page-relative path, no category dirs:

```
bundle/
  manifest.json     # the contract the hosting layer reads
  files/            # the payload — mirrors the page's folder verbatim
    page.html       # the page
    sine.py         # a fused.runPython() target
    logo.png        # a fused.rawUrl()/readFile() target
    helpers.py      # a first-party module a bundled entrypoint imports
```

`manifest.json` classifies each payload file by role (paths are relative to `root`):

```json
{
  "fused_render_bundle": 2,
  "root": "files",
  "page": "page.html",
  "entrypoints": [{ "path": "./sine.py", "name": "sine", "key": "sine.py" }],
  "assets": [{ "path": "./logo.png", "name": "logo.png" }],
  "resources": [{ "key": "helpers.py" }],
  "cache_max_age": "0s"
}
```

Each file's bundle location is `root/<path>` and that same path is its runtime key — there
is no separate `file` field. (The hosting layer also still reads legacy **v1** bundles —
`code/`/`assets/`/`resources/` category dirs with explicit `file` fields.)

- **entrypoints** map each `runPython` literal path to a served route name. When
  hosted, `fused.runPython("./sine.py", params)` becomes a `POST` to that route.
- **assets** map each `rawUrl`/`readFile` literal path to an asset key served by a
  read-only `_asset` route. That route honours **HTTP Range** requests (`206` +
  `Content-Range`, with `Accept-Ranges: bytes` on a full `200`), so a browser client can
  stream a large bundled file — e.g. geotiff.js reading a Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF
  byte-range by byte-range — directly from a hosted page, with no local range daemon.
- **resources** are sibling `.py` modules a bundled entrypoint `import`s, found by a
  static scan of the entrypoint sources (transitively). They are shipped so the served
  entrypoint's `import helpers` resolves, but — unlike an asset — a page never fetches
  them, so they are **not** web-served. Only absolute imports resolving to a `<name>.py`
  beside the page are bundled; stdlib/third-party imports and subpackages are left alone.
  A relative import (`from . import x`) is skipped — a hosted entrypoint runs without
  package context.

The hosting layer uses the manifest to wire the served page's runtime — which
literal path posts to which route — without re-parsing the HTML.

## Caching

`cache_max_age` is the deploy-time choice for how long the page's result may be
served from cache instead of re-executed — `"0s"` (off, the default) or a
duration like `"5m"`/`"1h"`/`"1d"` (a non-negative integer + `s`/`m`/`h`/`d` unit).
It applies **page-wide** — to every served route uniformly (the page shell, each
`runPython` route, and the `_asset` route), matching the managed backend's
mount-wide caching. This is safe against a redeploy serving stale content: the
hosting layer folds the full bundle into each route's cache key, so any content
change re-hashes it (and the `_asset` route's HTTP Range reads cache correctly
because the `Range` header is part of that key). A `POST /api/export` caller
sets `cache_max_age` in the request body; re-export whenever the choice changes
so the manifest carries the current value.

The manifest field is only **one** of the two ways this choice reaches a hosting
layer — see the fused repo's spec/serve/fused-render.md § Caching for the full
picture. An **AWS** environment's `build_html_artifact` reads this manifest field
directly, so it works on both a fresh `share create` and a later `share repoint`
(redeploy). A managed **Fused** environment does not read the manifest field for
caching at all — it is a mount-level control-plane setting, sent as an explicit
`share create --cache-max-age` (a caller wanting both backends to work correctly
sends both) — and it is fixed for the life of a mount token; a `repoint` cannot
change it, so it must be withheld on redeploys there and persisted separately
as the setting that is actually live. To actually change caching on a managed
environment, mint a fresh `share create` at a new URL with the new setting.

See spec/caching/serve.md for how the AWS dispatcher honors it (result caching,
cache-key scoping, the `X-Openfused-Cache` hit/miss header) and
`fused share cache-clear <token>` for forcing a recompute on either backend
without changing this setting.

## The portable subset of `window.fused`

A hosted page has no local filesystem behind it, so only part of the local
runtime API is portable:

| API | Hosted? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `fused.runPython(pyPath, params, opts?)` | ✅ | `pyPath` is bundled and served as a route the page posts to. Default stale-request cancellation (keyed by `pyPath`) and the `opts.key`/`opts.signal` controls (SPEC RH-9) work identically on the hosted page. |
| `fused.rawUrl(path)` | ✅ | `path` is bundled as a read-only asset. |
| `fused.readFile(path)` | ✅ | same bundling as `rawUrl`. |
| `fused.params.*` | ✅ | pure client-side URL state — unchanged. |
| `fused.env` | ✅ | runtime identity — `"local"` in the fused-render app, `"hosted"` here. Branch on it to gate local-only paths when deployed. |
| `fused.writeFile(...)` | ❌ | a hosted artifact is immutable. |
| `fused.stat(...)` | ❌ | no filesystem to stat. |
| `fused.ai(...)` | ❌ | runs the claude CLI — or a model resident on the author's own machine — neither of which a hosted page can reach. |
| `fused.ai.image(...)` / `fused.ai.transcribe(...)` / `fused.ai.embed(...)` / `fused.ai.models.*` | ❌ | local inference (SPEC §40): a resident worker process on the author's machine, writing to its disk — a PNG for `image`, a `.json`/`.txt` transcript for `transcribe`, nothing on disk for `embed` (it resolves with vectors alone, but the model is still a process on that machine — and its `kind`/`paths` options are refused per model by a route that is not there either). Like `fileIndex` and unlike bare `fused.ai(...)`, these are **not** currently blocking export errors: the exporter's check requires `fused.ai(`, so a dotted call slips past it. Gate them on `fused.env`. |
| `fused.capture.*` | ❌ | native capture (SPEC §45): a capture ends up as a FILE on the author's own disk, at a path the reply names. How the bytes get there differs per platform — the app's own process on macOS (behind a permission granted to FusedRender.app), the page's encoder streaming into a server-written file on Windows and Linux (CP-10) — and **neither is portable**: a hosted page has no server of the reader's to write to and no business writing to their disk if it did. The browser APIs it *does* have (`getDisplayMedia`, `MediaRecorder`) leave a blob rather than a path, which is the one thing this API exists to avoid, so it is absent rather than shimmed. Like `fileIndex` it is **not** a blocking export error (the exporter's check requires `fused.<name>(`, so the dotted calls slip past), which makes it a `fused.env` gating obligation: ask `fused.capture` for `sources()` and hide the record button when `available` is false, or branch on `fused.env === "local"` before drawing one at all. |
| `fused.fileIndex.search(...)` / `.query(...)` | ❌ | the index is a store on the author's own machine, built by scanning their filesystem; there is nothing behind it on a hosted page. Unlike `fused.ai` this is **not** currently a blocking export error, so a page that reads the index and is also meant to be deployed must gate on `fused.env`. |
| `fused.watchJob(...)` | ⚪️ | must be a **no-op stub** in the hosted runtime, like `trackJob` (SPEC BG-14): the handle exists and `watch` resolves with null, so a page that observes server-owned work still exports and runs. There is no download manager — and no server-side work — on a hosted page to observe. The stub lives in the `fused` wheel, a separate repo; this row is the obligation on it, not a report of its state. |
| `fused.trackJob(...)` | ⚪️ | a **no-op stub**: the handle and all its methods exist and resolve, so a page that reports progress exports and runs unchanged — there is simply no download manager on a hosted page to report to (SPEC BG-14). Unlike `fused.ai`, it does **not** block export: progress reporting is decoration, not data. |
| SSE live-reload | ❌ | the artifact does not change under the page. |

`fused.env` is the recommended way to tell the two environments apart: it is a
**positive** signal present in both runtimes (`"local"` vs `"hosted"`), not the
absence of a method — `writeFile`/`stat` exist in the hosted runtime too (they
throw), so sniffing for them misidentifies a hosted page as local.

## Rules the exporter enforces

Export **fails loudly** (nothing is written) when a page cannot be hosted
faithfully, rather than shipping a page whose data calls 404 at request time:

- **Literal `runPython` paths only.** A `runPython` path must be a quoted literal:
  a hosted entrypoint's served route name is derived from that literal, so a
  computed target (a variable, a template string) cannot be routed and is an error.
- **No unsupported API.** `writeFile`/`stat`/`ai` in the page are errors. The
  check matches `fused.<name>(`, so it catches `fused.ai(...)` but **not** the
  dotted local-inference calls (`fused.ai.image(...)`,
  `fused.ai.transcribe(...)`, `fused.ai.embed(...)`, `fused.ai.models.*`) — those export cleanly today
  and fail at runtime on the hosted page instead. Whether they should block, or
  stay a `fused.env` gating obligation like `fileIndex`, is an open call rather
  than an oversight to patch quietly: a page that only reaches for a local model
  behind an `env === "local"` branch is legitimately exportable.
- **In-bundle paths only.** Absolute paths and paths escaping the page directory
  (`..`) are rejected — a hosted page can only reach files inside its bundle.
- **Targets must exist.** A referenced `.py`/asset (or an `include` file) that
  isn't on disk is an error.

Some conditions are **warnings**, not errors — they don't block export:

- **Computed `rawUrl`/`readFile` paths.** The exporter can't discover the target from
  the HTML, but once you bundle it — via the page's bundle manifest (below) or an
  explicit `include` — the served `_asset` route looks the file up by its bundle key and
  the hosted runtime resolves the computed path to that key, so `fused.rawUrl("data/" +
  name)` resolves fine. (A call like that is a string *prefix* plus an expression, so it
  is treated as computed — it is **not** mis-bundled as a literal `data/` target.)
  This warning is **suppressed when a manifest-declared file actually lands in the
  bundle as an asset** — internally, once it backs the call it is no longer counted
  as an unresolved manifest entry. It is keyed on the surviving asset, not the raw
  manifest globs: a manifest file that is also a literal `rawUrl`/`readFile` target
  is folded into that literal reference instead, and one dropped by `exclude` is
  gone — either way the manifest entry no longer backs anything, so the warning
  still fires. A per-`/api/export`-call `include` never suppresses it, since that
  selection isn't checked in with the page.
- **Excluding a referenced file.** Dropping a file the page literally references is
  honored, but the page's call to it will 404 when hosted.

Route names are derived from the `.py` filename stem (`sine.py` → `sine`),
prefixed with `run-` if they would collide with a reserved serve route (`data`,
`health`, …) and suffixed `-2`, `-3`, … on duplicate stems.

## Choosing which files are bundled

By default the bundle is exactly the auto-detected set — the page plus every file
reached by a literal `runPython`/`rawUrl`/`readFile` call. `include` and `exclude`
layer a user selection on top:

- **`include`** — extra page-relative files bundled as read-only assets, beyond the
  scan. Use it for files reached by a computed path, or data a bundled `.py` reads
  at runtime, which the HTML scan can't see. An included file that duplicates an
  auto-detected asset is bundled once.
- **`exclude`** — page-relative paths (or their bundle key) dropped from the final
  set. Dropping an auto-detected target warns (its call 404s when hosted); dropping
  a file you only added via `include` is silent.

`/api/export` exposes both fields directly in its request body for driving a
bundle by hand — there is no UI in this app for editing the set interactively;
a caller wanting that built a "Will publish" list on top of these two fields.

Whatever backs a bundled asset — a literal `rawUrl()`/`readFile()` reference,
the page's own bundle manifest (below), or an explicit `include` — it is served
read-only by the `_asset` route the same way.

### The page's own bundle manifest (checked in, reproducible)

`include`/`exclude` above are a per-call selection, not checked in with the
page. To declare the bundle set **in the repo** — reviewable, reproducible, and
travelling inside the single HTML file — add one embedded manifest block to the page:

```html
<script type="application/fused-bundle">
{ "include": ["data/*.json", "boundaries/**/*.geojson"] }
</script>
```

- **`include`** takes page-relative **globs** (`*`, `?`, `**` for recursion) and/or
  literal paths — an entry with no `*`/`?` is a literal, so a real filename with brackets
  (e.g. a `file[1].json` browser download) is taken as-is, not a character class. Globs are
  expanded against the page dir at export time and each match runs
  the same safety checks as any asset (`..`/absolute/symlink escapes are rejected). A glob
  that matches nothing is a **warning**; a literal that isn't on disk is an **error**. The
  manifest set is folded in **beneath** any `/api/export` `include`.
- The block carries **no version** — the `type` attribute identifies it, and unknown keys
  are ignored, so new directives can be added later without breaking older exports. It is
  stripped from the HTML before the dependency scan, so its JSON body is never misread as a
  `fused.*` call.
- **`exclude` is not honored here** (it would publish the withheld file names in the served
  page source) — it is warned about; drop files via `/api/export`'s `exclude`
  instead.

This is the clean way to back a **computed** asset call: declare `"include": ["data/*.json"]`
and fetch with `fused.rawUrl("data/" + name)` — the glob bundles the files and the hosted
`_asset` route resolves the computed name by key, so there is no `RAW_URLS`-style table to
hand-maintain.

### Reading a bundled file / importing a module from a `runPython` entrypoint

The hosting layer materializes every bundled file at its **real page-relative path**
under the entrypoint's working directory — the runtime's cwd **and** `sys.path[0]`. So
from entrypoint Python your code reads and imports exactly as it did locally, with no
rewriting:

```python
import helpers                      # bundled automatically (a "resource") — resolves

def main():
    data = open("data.csv").read()  # <root>/data.csv — a bare relative open() works
    return helpers.process(data)
```

- **Data files** reached by `fused.rawUrl`/`readFile`, or added under "Include files"
  (below), land at their key, so `open("data.csv")` / `open("tiles/0.png")` resolve.
- **Modules** a bundled entrypoint imports are discovered and shipped automatically, so
  `import helpers` works. Only absolute imports of a sibling `<name>.py` are bundled; a
  relative import (`from . import x`) is not — a hosted entrypoint runs without package
  context.

Use a bare relative path — it is the form that matches both local and hosted. Do **not**
use `openfused.asset_path("data.csv")` here: that helper anchors under `<root>/assets/`
(the resource scheme the project/widget deploy path uses), whereas a hosted fused-render
page's files sit at the project root, so `asset_path` would point at a file that isn't
there. If you need an absolute path, anchor it yourself at the working directory, e.g.
`os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "data.csv")`.
