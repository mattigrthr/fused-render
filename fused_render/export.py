"""Export a renderable HTML page into a portable bundle for hosted serving.

fused-render is local-only by design (SPEC §1 "Never deployed to cloud"): the
server binds 127.0.0.1 and hosts nothing. This module does **not** change that.
It adds a pure, local *build* step — called via ``POST /api/export`` on the
already-running server (D71; see server.py) — that statically collects a page's
dependencies into a self-contained bundle directory. A separate hosting layer
(the ``fused`` wheel's ``build_html_artifact``) turns that bundle into a served
app; nothing here uploads or phones home.

Only the **portable subset** of the injected ``window.fused`` API is supported on
a hosted page, because a served page has no local filesystem behind it:

  * ``fused.runPython(pyPath, params)`` — supported. The referenced ``.py`` file
    is bundled and, when hosted, becomes a served entrypoint the page POSTs to.
  * ``fused.rawUrl(path)`` — supported. The referenced file is bundled as a
    read-only asset served by an ``_asset`` route.
  * ``fused.readFile(path)`` — supported (same bundling as ``rawUrl``).
  * ``fused.params`` — supported unchanged (pure client-side URL state).
  * ``fused.writeFile`` / ``fused.stat`` / SSE live-reload — **unsupported**: a
    hosted artifact is immutable and has no filesystem to stat. Their use in an
    exported page is reported as an error, not silently dropped.

Every path argument to ``runPython`` / ``rawUrl`` / ``readFile`` must be a **string
literal**. A dynamically-computed path (a variable, a template string) cannot be
resolved at build time, so the export fails loudly rather than shipping a page
whose data calls 404 at request time.

Known limitation: dependency scanning is a regex over the whole HTML, so a
``fused.runPython("…")``-shaped snippet sitting inside a JS string literal or an
HTML comment (never actually executed) is still treated as a real call. The
consequence is only a **loud** export error (a spurious missing-file or
non-literal-path failure) or a harmlessly-bundled extra file — never silent wrong
behavior at request time. Robustly excluding commented/quoted occurrences would
require a full JS tokenizer, which is disproportionate here; author pages so that
such look-alike text is not present, or split it out.

# A `fused.<method>(` call whose first argument is a COMPLETE quoted string literal — the

#   * The body **excludes its own delimiter** (`[^"\\]` / `[^'\\]`, with `\\.` for escapes),

    """Scan a page's HTML and build an :class:`ExportPlan` (pure — no files written).

    Resolves each literal ``runPython``/``rawUrl``/``readFile`` path against ``page_dir``,
    recording blocking problems (dynamic ``runPython`` paths, unsupported API,
    unsafe/missing files) in ``plan.errors`` rather than raising — so a caller can report
    them all at once.

    The auto-detected set is then adjusted by the user's selection:

      * ``include`` — extra page-relative files to bundle as read-only assets (beyond
        the literal ``rawUrl``/``readFile`` scan), from the caller AND from the page's
        embedded manifest (globs expanded, folded in first). Each goes through the same
        safety gauntlet as a scanned asset; a bad one is a blocking error. This is how a
        file reached by a *computed* path (a warning, below) or read at runtime by a
        bundled ``.py`` actually gets into the bundle.
      * ``exclude`` — page-relative paths (or their bundle key) to drop from the final
        set. Dropping a literally-referenced target is honored but warned (that call
        404s when hosted).

    A computed (non-literal) ``rawUrl``/``readFile`` path is a **warning**, not an error:
    the exporter can't discover the target, but the user can bundle it via ``include`` — or,
    reproducibly, via a page-adjacent ``<script type="application/fused-bundle">`` manifest
    whose ``include`` globs are expanded here and folded in **beneath** the caller's
    ``include`` (see :func:`_extract_bundle_manifest`). Once the target is bundled, the
    hosted ``_asset`` route resolves it by key, so a runtime-computed ``rawUrl`` path works.
    A computed ``runPython`` path stays a hard error (its served route name is derived
    from the literal path — there is nothing to route a computed call to).

    Finally, first-party **modules** the bundled entrypoints ``import`` (transitively) are
    discovered by a static AST scan (:func:`_discover_modules`) and recorded in
    ``plan.resources`` — sibling ``.py`` files shipped so a hosted entrypoint's
    ``import helpers`` resolves, without the author hand-listing them. Unlike assets they
    are runtime-only (never web-served). Only absolute imports resolving to a ``<name>.py``
    beside the page are bundled; stdlib/third-party imports and subpackages are left alone.
